  <h1>Assignment 9.3: JavaScripyt - Part 1</h1>
  <p>A ruler must not only appear virtuous but also understand when to act against virtue. A wise <span id="word1">_________</span> knows that generosity, while praised, can lead to financial ruin and resentment. Thus, he must manage his resources carefully, giving only when it secures loyalty and stability.</p>
  <p>It is far safer to be <span id="word2">_________</span> than loved. Love is fickle, subject to the whims of men, but fear ensures obedience. However, a ruler must avoid hatred, for hatred breeds rebellion. He must balance authority with justice to maintain his reign.</p>
  <p><span id="word3">_________</span> governs half of human affairs, but the other half is within our control. A bold ruler seizes opportunities, shaping destiny rather than waiting idly. In the end, <span id="word4">_________</span> belongs to those who dare to act decisively.</p>
