        <h2>Chapter Title: Introduction to [Your Name]</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">I grew up in a small town where everyone knew each other. It was a peaceful place with lots of open spaces to explore. My childhood was filled with adventures, climbing trees, and biking with friends.</p>
        
        <p>My hobbies include painting, reading, and coding. One of my favorite hobbies is <span class="sentence">spending weekends hiking through nature trails.</span> It allows me to clear my mind and stay active at the same time.</p>
        
        <p>Family has always been a cornerstone in my life. We enjoy celebrating holidays together and have many cherished traditions. Cooking with my family is one of my favorite pastimes.</p>
        
        <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in software development. My goal is to create innovative solutions and build meaningful applications that positively impact people's lives.</p>
